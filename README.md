Waldo Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks <br>
	This project aims to detect Waldo in images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. It involves preprocessing the dataset, balancing the classes, applying data augmentation, training the CNN model, and evaluating its performance.

Project Overview <be>
	Objective: Develop a CNN model to accurately detect Waldo in images.<br>
	Dataset: Images containing Waldo and non-Waldo pieces of various sizes (64x64, 128x128, 256x256) and color schemes (original color, black and white, grayscale).<br>
	Challenges: Addressing the class imbalance between Waldo and non-Waldo images, preventing overfitting, and improving model generalization.
